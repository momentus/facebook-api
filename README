FacebookAPI

This is a more lightweight, less cookie-dependent api and sdk library for Facebook using PHP

In this README:
- Our Goals
- How to Use
- Integrating with Code Igniter


OUR GOALS

These are our favorite methods in the PHP SDK, but opened up publicly, and stripped down so that the method isn't doing any other logic behind the scenes. The requirements were:
- No single machine dependency, for load balancing Facebook apps
- Do not require client cookies- with our apps in tabs and iFrames, many browsers block 3rd party cookies
- Allow for an unauthenticated flow. Some of our apps don't require authentication but use API methods. 
- For apps in the frame, tab, canvas, or outside of it.

For practical examples, see "test.php."

HOW TO USE

1) require the library 
require("/var/www/html/tools/facebook-api/facebook.php");

2) Pass configuration properties to the new class' object;

$facebook = new Facebook(
  array(
		'app_id'=>"My app id", 
		'app_secret'=>"my app secret",
		'fb_canvas_url'=>"https://apps.facebook.com/yourappnamespace/",
		'redirect_uri'=>"https://apps.facebook.com/yourappnamespace/yourpage.php"
	)
);

3) Use the methods!


-- Signed Requests

$facebook->getSignedRequest();

Gets the signed requests and decodes it. Returns the signed_request object (array).

$facebook->checkRequest();

Similar to "getSignedRequest" this checks the signed_request and returns the user's UID. Similar to Facebook-php-sdk's "getUser()."

AUTHENTICATION


$auth_uri = $facebook->getAuthUri("publish_stream,user_photos");

Use this url to log users in, and accept permissions. The parameters are: the permissions! You setup the redirect_uri when you setup the facebook object. If you want a different redirect, re-assign it: "$facebook->redirect_uri = "https://www.co.com/mynewpage.php";"

$facebook->getAccessTokenFromCode($code); 

Pass in the code, and get in return, the access token. This also assigns the object's variable "$facebook->access_token". You don't have to explicitly pass around the access token if you want, it's available from $facebook.

$facebook->getAccessToken(); 

This will query the likely subjects for the access token, and assign it to the $facebook->access_token object.

QUERYING THE FACEBOOK SOCIAL GRAPH

$me = $facebook->api("me");

The first argument is the Graph Object-- the User, the photo, the event, etc. The second argument is an array containing any Graph parameters you wish- "since" date to narrow results, here I've passed "limit" to limit the result, and "fields" to show only the attributes of the object I'm interested in.

The result is a standard object format (it's the default json decode format). 

More complex example:
$photos= $facebook->api("me/photos", array("fields"=>"images", "limit"=>"10"));


INTEGRATING WITH CODE IGNITER

To integrate with Code Igniter (tested on v. 2.1.0)

1) Copy facebook.php into /libraries

2) Create a configuration directory for your environment in applicationg/config:

"development"

3) Inside there, add a file called "facebook.php"

4) Define the following constants:

$config['app_id'] = "YOUR APP ID";
$config['app_secret'] = "YOUR SECRET";
$config['fb_canvas_url'] = "PATH TO CANVAS APP IF APPLICABLE";
$config['redirect_uri'] = "FULL PATH TO REDIRECT URI"; // i.e. http://myapp.com/index.php

5) Edit config/autoload.php, add facebook to the libraries array:

"$autoload['libraries'] = array('facebook');"

6) That should do it- to use the facebook api, on your home page create teh auth link:

$auth_uri = $this->facebook->getAuthUri("publish_stream");

7) On the receiving redirect method, make sure to "

$this->facebook->getAccessToken();

And you can start querying the graph, etc.
